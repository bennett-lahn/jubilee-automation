; Home X Axis

; In case homex.g is called in isolation, ensure 
; (1) U axis is homed (which performs tool detection and sets machine tool state to a known state) and 
; (2) Y axis is homed (to prevent collisions with the tool posts)
; (3) Y axis is in a safe position (see 2)
; (4) No tools are loaded.
; Ask for user-intervention if either case fails.
